## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to analyze the island Oahu's weather data so that the client would understand how weather might have an effect a potential surf shop business. The client has mentioned they had once attempted to open a business in Hawaii but lack of understanding the weather and it's effect on the number of customers led to the business failing.

A preliminary analysis was done by checking the past years weather at June and at December which would provide the customer an image of what to expect during a "hot" summer month and a cold "winter" month.

## Results
The summary statistics of the June and December temperatures at Oahu is shown in the following figures.

The stats show that there isn't too much of a difference in mean temperatures in summer and/or winter months. This was expected as the island has been known to be tropical and majority of tropical locations tend to have relatively consistent weather the whole year. It is very important for the client to be aware that December still has weather as cold as 56Â°F and should make note of slow business during times like that.
